## Setting Up Python

### Installation

1. **Download Python**: Visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version for your operating system.
2. **Install Python**: Run the installer and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" before clicking Install.
3. **Verify Installation**: Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux) and type:

```
python --version
```

You should see the Python version number if installation was successful.

### Choosing an Editor

You have several options:

- **IDLE**: Comes bundled with Python, good for beginners
- **VS Code**: Free, powerful editor with excellent Python support
- **PyCharm**: Full-featured Python IDE (free Community Edition available)

## Python Basics

### Your First Program

Create a file named `hello.py` and add this code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Run it from the command line:

```
python hello.py
```

### Variables and Assignment

```python
# Variables don't need to be declared with a type
name = "John"
age = 30
height = 5.9

# You can print variables easily
print(name)
print(f"Age: {age}, Height: {height}")
```

### User Input

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Input returns strings, so convert for numbers
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print(f"Next year, you'll be {age + 1} years old.")
```

## Data Types

### Numbers

```python
# Integers
x = 5
y = -10

# Floating point
pi = 3.14159
e = 2.71828

# Basic operations
sum = x + y
product = x * y
quotient = pi / 2
exponent = 2 ** 3  # 2 raised to the power of 3 (equals 8)
```

### Strings

```python
greeting = "Hello"
name = "Python"

# String concatenation
message = greeting + ", " + name + "!"
print(message)  # Hello, Python!

# String methods
print(name.upper())  # PYTHON
print(message.lower())  # hello, python!
print(len(message))  # 14 (length of string)
```

### Lists

```python
# A list can contain mixed types
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]

# Accessing elements (zero-indexed)
print(fruits[0])  # apple
print(fruits[-1])  # cherry (negative indexes count from the end)

# Modifying lists
fruits.append("orange")  # Add to the end
fruits.insert(1, "blueberry")  # Insert at position
fruits.remove("banana")  # Remove by value
popped = fruits.pop()  # Remove and return the last item

# List slicing
print(numbers[1:3])  # [2, 3] (elements from index 1 up to but not including 3)
```

### Dictionaries

```python
# Key-value pairs
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25,
    "job": "Developer"
}

# Accessing values
print(person["name"])  # Alice

# Adding or modifying entries
person["email"] = "alice@example.com"
person["age"] = 26

# Checking if a key exists
if "job" in person:
    print(f"Job: {person['job']}")
```

## Control Flow

### Conditional Statements

```python
age = 18

if age < 13:
    print("Child")
elif age < 18:
    print("Teenager")
else:
    print("Adult")
```

### Loops

```python
# For loop with a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"I like {fruit}s")

# For loop with a range
for i in range(5):  # 0 to 4
    print(i)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

### Break and Continue

```python
# Break exits the loop entirely
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)  # Prints 0 through 4

# Continue skips the rest of the current iteration
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)  # Prints only odd numbers
```

## Functions

### Defining Functions

```python
def greet(name):
    """This function greets the person passed in as a parameter"""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Calling the function
message = greet("Python")
print(message)  # Hello, Python!
```

### Default Parameters

```python
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    return f"{greeting}, {name}!"

print(greet("Python"))  # Hello, Python!
print(greet("Python", "Hi"))  # Hi, Python!
```

### Multiple Return Values

```python
def calculate(a, b):
    addition = a + b
    subtraction = a - b
    return addition, subtraction

add, sub = calculate(10, 5)
print(f"10 + 5 = {add}")  # 10 + 5 = 15
print(f"10 - 5 = {sub}")  # 10 - 5 = 5
```

## Working with Files

### Reading Files

```python
# Reading an entire file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

# Reading line by line
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())  # strip() removes newline characters
```

### Writing to Files

```python
# Writing to a file (overwrites existing content)
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, Python!")

# Appending to a file
with open("output.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("\nLearning file handling.")
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've learned the basics, here are some suggestions for what to explore next:

1. **Error Handling**: Learn about try/except blocks
2. **Modules and Packages**: Import and use external code
3. **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes and objects in Python
4. **Data Science Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
5. **Web Development**: Flask or Django frameworks

## Practice Projects

The best way to learn is by doing. Try these beginner projects:

1. **To-Do List App**: Store and manage a list of tasks
2. **Simple Calculator**: Build a calculator with basic operations
3. **Password Generator**: Create random, secure passwords
4. **Weather App**: Fetch and display weather data using an API
5. **Text-Based Game**: Create a simple adventure game
